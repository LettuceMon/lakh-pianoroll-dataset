## LPD

[lpd-full](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1md7aRHa7KZQhmzNBaFm0zp_SP-cHJZpP&export=download)
contains 174,154 multi-track piano-rolls derived from MIDI files in the
[Lakh MIDI Dataset](http://colinraffel.com/projects/lmd/) (LMD).

## LPD-matched

[lpd-matched](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1UjOCRr5VOr8AbcbsOxmUBX1ExKvLvVlu&export=download)
contains 115,160 multi-track piano-rolls derived from MIDI files of 30,886 songs
in *lmd-matched*. These files are matched to entries in the Million Song Dataset
(MSD). To make use of the metadata provided by MSD, we refer users to the
[demo page](http://colinraffel.com/projects/lmd/) of LMD.

[matched_ids.txt](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1UjOCRr5VOr8AbcbsOxmUBX1ExKvLvVlu&export=download)
provides a list of all file ids and the matched MSD ids in the matched subset.

## LPD-cleansed

[lpd-cleansed](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1akX1l_pHq83IWBWjbSAdrnykyov30ZRb&export=download)
contains 21,425 multi-track piano-rolls collected from *lpd-matched* with the
following rules.

- Remove those having more than one time signature change events
- Remove those having a time signature other than 4/4
- Remove those whose first beat not starting from time zero
- Keep only one file that has the highest confidence score in matching for each
  song\*

[cleansed_ids.txt](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1k_BHTAToq0KcUSHN6icb1JJv7gKgHnq7&export=download)
provides a list of all file ids and the matched MSD ids in the cleansed subset.

\* *The matching confidence scores come with the LMD, which is the confidence of
whether the MIDI file match any entry in the MSD.*

## MIDI Info Dictionary

[midis.json](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=18kAwcriMi46s4TG0SQudkL-iBW6EGlKi&export=download)
contains useful information lost during the conversion from LMD to LPD. It was
used to create *lpd-cleansed*.

- `first_beat_time`: the actual timing of the first beat
- `num_time_signature_change`: the number of time signature change events
- `constant_time_signature`: the *only* time signature used (`None` if it
  changes within a song)
- `constant_tempo`: the *only* tempo (in bpm) used (`None` if it changes within
  a song)
