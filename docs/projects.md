[MuseGAN](https://salu133445.github.io/musegan/) is a project on music
generation. In essence, we aim to generate polyphonic music of multiple tracks
(instruments) with harmonic and rhythmic structure, multi-track interdependency
and temporal structure. To our knowledge, our work represents the first approach
that deal with these issues altogether.

The models are trained with
[Lakh Pianoroll Dataset](https://salu133445.github.io/musegan/dataset) (LPD), a
new [multi-track piano-roll](https://salu133445.github.io/musegan/data) dataset,
in an unsupervised approach. The proposed models are able to generate music
either from scratch, or by accompanying a track given by user. Specifically, we
use the model to generate pop song phrases consisting of bass, drums, guitar,
piano and strings tracks.

Listen to some of the best phrases.
